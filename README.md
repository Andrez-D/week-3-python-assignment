It is a python function used to calculate discount.

How this works:
The function applies the discount only if the discount percentage is 20% or greater.

It returns the original price if the discount percent is less than 20.

The user inputs are converted to float and handled safely with try-except for invalid input.

You can run this in any Python environment to test it interactively.
